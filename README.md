# PracticeDecorationPattern
Let's say we want to create a couple of dialogs, and they all have the same style of title and positive button. 
The only difference of these dialogs is the content in the center area. I don't want re-write the title and the button 
when every time I design a new dialog. So probably the first thought we come up with is to inherit a base dialog which has
defined title and button and leave the content view to be implemented. It is a way to achieve the goal, but I want to try 
a different way - Using Decoration Pattern.(But maybe it's not that so similar to what we knew about the Decoration 
Pattern)
